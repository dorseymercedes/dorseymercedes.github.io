I've had started many courses in the past that I felt aligned with what my family wanted me to do. When I graduated high school (over 10 years ago) I went straight to college with an 10 year plan to become an OB/GYN and only completed two years before I dropped out due to my overwhelming schedule and stress. I slowly bounced from job to job while taking classes on various things I thought would make a good career for me. In the back of my mind though I tried to stay away from working with computers for I thought I couldn’t possibly make a career out of something I enjoyed and like that much. 

I took courses on teaching, animal husbandry, biology, and even accounting. My family wanted me to stay the course with something medical and when I would talk of moving outside of that I would be met with disappoval. The only person that had me looking into a career as a Software Engineer was my biological mother who was before she pass last year a engineer for Microsoft and always encouraged me to go to school for it but I felt like it was too late for me and I just didn't have the time.

I finally settled into my current career as a Flight Attendant four years ago and thought it was the end of the searching. I thought that I wouldn’t need to explore more career options and look further into more accessible coding courses. And then COVID-19 happened.

It made me realize that while my current career is what some people dream of doing it’s not was I wanted and that life is too short and unpredictable to not go for what you want. I immediately start looking into classes for the career I knew I  wanted. I read every review, post, reddit thread, and followed pretty much every coder that came from a non coding background on Instagram. I practiced and joined pretty much all the recommended sites and apps to gauge my skills and learning style. Then I finally put in some applications for bootcamps.

I chose Flatiron to study Software Engineering for I finally wanted to go for the career that *I* wanted. This school was the one that hits all the marks that I know would help me succeed and I’m ecstatic to start my journey.
